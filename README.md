# 🎣 Go Fish – Decentralized Payments for the Global Fishing Industry

**Go Fish** is a decentralized payment platform built on **Polkadot**, designed to streamline and secure the fishing import/export ecosystem. By leveraging blockchain, we tackle the industry's core pain points—delays, fees, and trust—while empowering exporters, importers, and investors through instant, transparent, and equitable transactions.

---

## 📌 Why Go Fish?

The fishing trade is a multi-billion-dollar industry riddled with inefficiencies:

- ⏳ **Payment Delays** – Exporters wait months due to centralized banking.
- 💸 **High Costs** – Tariffs (up to 30%) and intermediaries reduce margins.
- 🌍 **Tariff Wars** – Political tensions (e.g., US-China) stall deals.
- 💱 **Currency Volatility** – FX fluctuations eat into profits.
- 🔒 **Lack of Trust** – Opaque systems create skepticism and friction.

**Go Fish** leverages Polkadot's infrastructure to resolve these issues via decentralized finance—offering instant payments, lower costs, and trustless smart contracts.
